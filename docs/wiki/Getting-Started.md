# Getting Started

## 1. Install plugin and server

Follow installation in:

- root `README.md`
- `plugin/README.md`

## 2. Configure plugin

In Lightroom Plug-in Manager:

- set backend server URL
- configure provider/API keys
- set Vertex project/location if needed

## 3. Index photos

Run:

- `Library -> Plug-in Extras -> Analyze & Index Photos`

Then use:

- Advanced Search
- People
- Retrieve Metadata

## 4. Run one-time ID migration (upgrade path)

If you upgraded from an older release with UUID-based backend IDs:

1. Open `File -> Plug-in Manager`
2. Open LrGeniusAI settings
3. In `Backend Server`, click **Migrate existing DB IDs to photo_id**
4. Wait until the progress scope finishes

This is a one-time step.

## 5. Run culling on similar photos

After indexing, you can run the image culling workflow to quickly review bursts and near-duplicates:

1. Select photos or use the current view in Lightroom.
2. Open `Library -> Plug-in Extras -> Cull Similar Photos`.
3. Choose the desired culling preset (for example `default` or `sports`) and scope.
4. Wait for the backend to group and rank your photos.
5. Review the created collection set with:
   - `Picks`
   - `Alternates`
   - `Reject Candidates`
   - optional `Duplicates / Near Duplicates`

Each run creates a timestamped collection set and switches Lightroom to the Picks collection for immediate review.

## 6. Create a DB backup

Before migrations, server moves, or larger backend maintenance, create a backup from Lightroom:

1. Open `File -> Plug-in Manager`
2. Open LrGeniusAI settings
3. In `Backend Server`, click `Download DB backup`
4. Save the generated `.zip` file to a safe location

The backup contains the full persistent backend DB directory, including Chroma data as well as SQLite and JSON files.

## 7. Vertex AI login

Use gcloud ADC on the server host:

```bash
gcloud init
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
gcloud auth application-default login
```

If the backend runs in Docker Compose on a remote server, run the login inside the container instead:

```bash
mkdir -p gcloud
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec geniusai-server gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
docker compose exec geniusai-server gcloud auth application-default login
```

For headless SSH hosts without a browser:

```bash
docker compose exec geniusai-server gcloud auth application-default login --no-browser
```

The bind mount `./gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud` keeps ADC and the active gcloud project persistent across container restarts and rebuilds.
