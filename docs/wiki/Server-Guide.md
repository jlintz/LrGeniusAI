# Server Guide

The Python backend (`geniusai-server`) acts as the brains of LrGeniusAI. It runs locally via FastAPI and handles Large Language Model (LLM) inference, image embedding generation using OpenCLIP, and vector database management.

## Main Documentation

For configuration settings, dependency management, and architecture details, refer to the [`server/README.md`](Server-README).

## Key Responsibilities

The backend server is responsible for:
- **Image Indexing:** Offloading heavy ML workloads (like OpenCLIP processing) away from the Lightroom UI.
- **Semantic Search:** Executing fast, vector-based similarity searches using ChromaDB.
- **Metadata Persistence:** Keeping a high-performance secondary SQLite database for tags, face matching, and other AI-generated text.
- **Face & Person APIs:** Processing and matching facial data to build identity maps over time.
- **Model Caching:** Automatically downloading and verifying local storage sizes of OpenCLIP and lightweight models to avoid redundant downloads. The `/status` endpoint exposes an `is_model_cached` flag which allows the Lightroom plugin to display warning messages if required assets are missing prior to initiating a task.

## Error Handling & Logic

The API is structured to return robust Error responses. In the event of batch processing failures, endpoints will format exact stack traces and JSON objects detailing which images failed and why (e.g. timeout, invalid model reference, API quota limits). This structured data is intercepted by the plugin to generate user-friendly GUI error reports. 

If you are experiencing unexpected backend behavior:
1. Try parsing the terminal output or log files written to the server's working directory. 
2. Refer to the [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting) wiki page to debug the server connection.

## Database Backup Workflow

Given the importance of your generated search indexes and AI metadata, the backend exposes a dedicated backup download flow:
- API endpoint: `GET /db/backup`
- Output: A comprehensive ZIP archive containing the complete DB directory (Chroma data, SQLite db, and associated JSON files).

**To create a backup via Lightroom:**
Open `File -> Plug-in Manager -> LrGeniusAI -> Backend Server` and click **Download DB backup**.

**When to backup:**
We highly recommend initiating a backup prior to running large one-time DB migrations, moving the server to a new machine, or updating backend dependencies.
