# Image Culling Implementation Plan

## Goal

Build an `Image Culling` workflow that is useful for real photographers, explainable, affordable to run, and compatible with the existing `Lightroom + local backend` architecture.

This plan assumes that the current LLM-based quality scoring remains inactive and is **not** used as the core ranking signal for the MVP.

## Product Direction

The first release should not try to answer the vague question "How good is this photo?" with a single expensive model score.

Instead, the workflow should:

1. group similar photos into burst/stack candidates
2. detect obvious rejects using technical and face-aware signals
3. rank images relative to other images in the same group
4. create Lightroom collections for picks, alternates, and reject candidates

## Guiding Principles

- Prefer deterministic, explainable signals over opaque global scores.
- Rank relatively within similar groups, not only globally across the full catalog.
- Keep the hot path local and affordable. Do not use LLMs per image for core culling decisions.
- Store individual culling signals separately so they can be inspected, tuned, and reused.
- Make the first version review-friendly rather than fully automatic.

## MVP Scope

The MVP should support:

- culling within `selected photos` and `current view`
- grouping near-duplicate and burst images
- picking the best image per group
- identifying weak images and reject candidates
- creating Lightroom collections from the result
- showing short reasons for ranking decisions

The MVP should not require:

- genre-specific tuning for every photography niche
- personalized taste learning
- LLM-generated critiques
- fully automatic star ratings across the whole catalog

## Recommended Scoring Model

Use a layered ranking model instead of a single score.

### Layer 1: Grouping

Group photos using a combination of:

- `capture_time`
- `pHash` or another cheap near-duplicate signal
- existing image embeddings
- optional face-count consistency for people-heavy bursts

### Layer 2: Hard reject signals

Compute clear negative indicators such as:

- strong blur or missed focus
- face blur when faces are present
- eyes closed / blink
- severe exposure problems
- obvious occlusion or poor facial visibility

### Layer 3: Best-shot signals

Within each group, reward:

- sharpest main subject
- best face quality
- best expression / eyes-open result
- cleanest exposure
- strongest relative composition or framing

### Layer 4: Optional aesthetic prior

Add a lightweight aesthetic model later as a weak secondary signal:

- `NIMA`
- CLIP-based aesthetic predictor
- newer IQA / aesthetics models after evaluation

This layer should influence ordering, but not override hard technical rejects.

## Data Model

Do not store only one `overall quality` field. Store granular culling signals.

Recommended new backend metadata fields:

- `cull_group_id`
- `cull_group_size`
- `cull_group_rank`
- `cull_group_winner`
- `cull_score`
- `cull_sharpness`
- `cull_face_sharpness`
- `cull_blink_penalty`
- `cull_exposure`
- `cull_noise`
- `cull_occlusion`
- `cull_aesthetic`
- `cull_reject_candidate`
- `cull_reason_codes`
- `cull_explanation`

## Backend Work Plan

### Phase 1: Grouping Foundation

- Implement `group_and_sort_images(...)` in `server/src/service_chroma.py`.
- Add burst grouping logic based on time window plus similarity threshold.
- Support both true duplicates and near-duplicates.
- Return groups in a structure that the plugin can map to Lightroom collections.

Acceptance criteria:

- Similar photos are grouped reliably for common burst sequences.
- Ungrouped photos still return as single-item groups.
- Output is deterministic for the same input set.

### Phase 2: Technical Culling Signals

- Add image-level technical metrics in the backend.
- Start with cheap and robust signals:
  - sharpness / blur
  - exposure sanity
  - highlight / shadow clipping approximation
  - noise estimate
- Store metrics in Chroma metadata or a dedicated culling result structure.

Acceptance criteria:

- Clearly blurred or badly exposed images rank lower than clean alternatives in the same group.
- Metrics can be logged and inspected during tuning.

### Phase 3: Face-Aware Culling

- Reuse existing face detection infrastructure.
- Add face-level quality checks when faces are present:
  - face sharpness
  - eye openness / blink
  - face size / prominence
  - occlusion / poor visibility where feasible
- Aggregate face signals into image-level culling fields.

Acceptance criteria:

- In portrait or group-photo bursts, images with sharper open eyes rank above blink shots.
- Photos without faces fall back cleanly to generic technical ranking.

### Phase 4: Relative Ranking per Group

- Define the first `cull_score` formula.
- Rank only inside each group first.
- Mark the top image as `group winner`.
- Mark bottom images with strong negative signals as `reject candidates`.
- Keep weights configurable in code for fast tuning.

Initial weight suggestion:

- `40%` technical quality
- `35%` face-aware quality when faces exist
- `15%` relative framing / composition proxy
- `10%` aesthetic prior

Acceptance criteria:

- Every group has a stable winner.
- Ranking reasons can be explained from stored sub-scores.

### Phase 5: Plugin Workflow

- Add a dedicated Lightroom task, for example `Cull Similar Photos`.
- Support scopes:
  - selected photos
  - current view
- Provide conservative output options:
  - `Picks`
  - `Alternates`
  - `Reject Candidates`
  - optional `Duplicates / Near Duplicates`
- Create collections and switch the user to the result collection set.

Acceptance criteria:

- A photographer can run culling on a selection and immediately review grouped results in Lightroom.
- No catalog metadata is overwritten unless explicitly requested.

### Phase 6: Explainability and Tuning

- Surface short explanations for each winner or reject.
- Example reason codes:
  - `sharpest_in_group`
  - `eyes_closed`
  - `face_blur`
  - `better_exposure_available`
  - `near_duplicate_weaker`
- Add debug logging or an internal diagnostics mode for score inspection.

Acceptance criteria:

- Ranking decisions are explainable enough to debug and improve.
- Thresholds can be tuned without redesigning the system.

## Plugin / API Changes

Recommended new API endpoint behavior:

- keep `/group_similar` as the technical grouping endpoint
- add a higher-level culling endpoint later, for example `/cull`
- return structured groups, winners, alternates, and reject candidates

Recommended plugin additions:

- new task file for culling workflow
- collection creation helper shared with search / people workflows
- optional review dialog for thresholds and output mode

## Suggested Implementation Order

1. Finish `group_and_sort_images(...)`
2. Add technical metrics and per-group ranking
3. Add Lightroom collection workflow
4. Add face-aware ranking
5. Add explanations and diagnostics
6. Evaluate a small aesthetic model as secondary signal

## Explicit Non-Goals for First Release

- no LLM scoring in the hot path
- no full personalized taste model
- no genre auto-detection dependency
- no mandatory cloud service
- no automatic destructive reject action

## Evaluation Strategy

Before full rollout, create a small internal benchmark set with:

- weddings / events
- portraits
- family / kids
- travel / street

For each set, compare:

- best-shot accuracy within groups
- reject precision
- number of wrong winners
- user trust in explanations
- runtime and cost

## Open Technical Questions

- Which sharpness metric performs best on RAW-derived previews in this pipeline?
- Should blink detection be implemented through landmarks, eye aspect ratio, or a lightweight classifier?
- Should culling results live only in Chroma metadata, or also in Lightroom plugin properties?
- Should the first UX focus on `collection output only`, or also on an in-plugin review dialog?
